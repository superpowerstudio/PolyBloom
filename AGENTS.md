### 0. Global Rules (All Agents)

- **Repo & Branching**
  - Work only in the `_EYES_ONLY_` repo (`superpowerstudio/_EYES_ONLY_`).
  - Never push directly to `main`. Always create feature branches from `main` (e.g. `feature/ui-grid`, `feature/data-spine`).
  - Keep branches scoped and surgical. Prefer many small, tight PRs over giant ones.
  - Before branching, ensure local `main` is up to date (`git pull --rebase origin main`, resolving conflicts manually if needed).
  - Never modify git configuration (`git config`), never use `--force` pushes.

- **PR Discipline**
  - Every PR must:
    - Have a crisp title and 2–5 bullet summary.
    - Include at least one screenshot or short screen recording if UI/UX changes are involved.
    - Link back to the relevant section in `COORDINATION_BOARD.md` and update that file with squad/branch/PR/status.
    - Pass lint and basic tests locally before opening.

- **Quality Bar**
  - Pixel-perfect visual polish; design > decent > good > excellent > ruthless refinement.
  - 60fps interactions; no jank, no layout popping, no flashing white backgrounds.
  - Accessible by default: proper contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA where applicable.
  - Safe by default: any code that could touch real funds must be behind paper-trading by default and explicit confirmation gates.

- **Tools & Stack**
  - Turborepo monorepo.
  - `apps/web`: Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Recharts, TradingView lightweight-charts.
  - `apps/mobile`: Expo 52 (React Native), TypeScript, shared UI library.
  - `packages/ui`: Shared components and theme tokens across web + mobile.

- **Coordination**
  - Reflect your work in `COORDINATION_BOARD.md` under your squad section and the PR log.
  - Keep scope tight: if you discover new subproblems, file follow-up tasks instead of ballooning the current PR.

### 1. `UI_SWAT` – Interface & Layout Strike Team

  - Branch prefix: `feature/ui-...` (e.g. `feature/ui-shell`, `feature/ui-grid`).
  - Tag your PRs with `[UI_SWAT]` in the title.

- **Definition of Done**

- **Branch & PR Conventions**
  - Branch prefix: `feature/claw-...` (e.g. `feature/claw-control-v1`).
  - Tag PRs with `[OPENCLAW_COMMANDO]`.

- **Definition of Done**
